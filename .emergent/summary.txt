The AI engineer's work primarily focused on expanding an e-commerce MVP, tackling significant technical debt and new feature requests. Initially, it addressed React 19 compatibility issues with  by first removing , then migrating to . A major effort involved building a comprehensive CMS backend (models, database, routes) and frontend (admin pages, navigation) for various entities like , , , , , and . Significant time was spent debugging persistent frontend routing issues in the Emergent preview environment, leading to a switch to  and repeated restarts. A key data challenge was ensuring complete machine model data, which involved multiple crawling and seeding iterations, ultimately reaching 530 models and adding a Mini Excavator Tracks category. The trajectory ends with a persistent issue regarding missing models on the frontend and the ongoing crawl to fully mirror .

The user requires an SEO-optimized e-commerce platform for rubber tracks and undercarriage parts with a modern industrial design. It needs a comprehensive admin panel for product management (CRUD, SEO fields, bulk import), order/customer management, and extensive content management (CMS for all site pages, rich text editing, dynamic SEO-friendly URLs, blog, FAQ, review management). The public site must support dynamic search by machine models and track sizes, interactive category navigation, and dedicated machine model pages. Paramount is full A-Z SEO, including dynamic XML sitemap, robots.txt, 301 redirect management, various Schema.org markups, image SEO, page speed, comprehensive link management, and an optimized 404 page. Recent work also involves ensuring all brands and machine models from  are present and manageable in the admin.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's report of a missing  model on the live site, indicating incomplete machine model data. This led to the discovery that  was indeed missing from the database and the  file. The AI initiated a specific crawl of  for Takeuchi models to verify the completeness of the data source. The aim is to ensure the admin panel and public site perfectly mirror 's model listings, especially after previous efforts that expanded the models from 227 to 530 (including mini excavators) and added the Mini Excavator Tracks category. The routing issues in the preview environment persist, making it difficult for the user to verify frontend changes directly.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the specific crawl for Takeuchi models and update the  file and database with any newly discovered models.
