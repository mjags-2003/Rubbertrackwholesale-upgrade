The previous AI engineerâ€™s work focused on significantly enhancing an e-commerce platform for rubber tracks and undercarriage parts. Initial efforts involved extensive troubleshooting of preview caching issues and an empty database. The engineer then successfully imported a large dataset of track sizes and machine compatibility from a user-provided spreadsheet and later from Rubbertrax for specific parts.

Key developments included revamping the frontend search functionalities: fixing the Rubber Track Compatibility Chart search, implementing a universal top search bar for various parts (rubber tracks, rollers, idlers, sprockets), and refining the Find Parts By Equipment section. Recurring challenges involved persistent browser/CDN caching issues on the preview link and fixing backend  bugs that led to 500 errors.

The engineer introduced new backend models and API routes for  entities, enabling detailed administration and public search. Crucially, an In Stock toggle was added to admin for fine-grained control over frontend pricing and availability display. The final phase involved integrating rubber track compatibility data into the main Find Parts By Equipment search, revealing a gap in the original data source (Camso sheet) regarding track loaders. The last action was initiating a comprehensive web crawl of  to address this data gap.

The application's goal is an SEO-optimized e-commerce platform for rubber tracks and undercarriage parts, featuring a comprehensive admin panel (for products, orders, customers, CMS with rich text editing, SEO fields) and a public site with dynamic search, interactive navigation, and SEO-optimized model pages.

Recent requirements included mirroring 's brands/models, and developing a Rubber Track Compatibility Chart. This chart needed to:
- Match track sizes with compatible machine models.
- Display compatible track sizes for a given model.
- Offer mm/inch unit toggles.
- Allow admin input for track size prices, appearing site-wide.
- Feature a Request Price Quote button revealing prices.
- Admin track size management required inline editing and a search bar.
- A master password system for admin edit/delete permissions was requested but not implemented.

Further, the platform expanded to include rollers, idlers, and sprockets. This necessitated:
- Crawling  for part numbers for specific brands (Kubota, Caterpillar) and creating a dedicated admin section for managing these parts.
- The main search bar and Find Parts By Equipment section must universally search all items (rubber tracks, rollers, idlers, sprockets) regardless of stock.
- An In Stock toggle in admin to control the display of prices and an In Stock badge on the frontend.
- Rubber tracks should be searchable by size; other parts by brand/model/part number.
- Compatibility data from  for models like CAT 277B needs to be integrated.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical data and search integration gap. The user identified that searching for Cat 277B with Rubber Tracks in the Find Parts By Equipment section did not display the expected track size details (e.g., 18x4x56) from . The engineer recognized that the  was not querying the  and  collections when Rubber Tracks was selected as a part option, and also that the  spreadsheet data (previously imported) lacked compatibility information for track loaders like the Cat 277B.

To resolve this, the AI engineer updated  to dynamically fetch and display track compatibility data when the Rubber Tracks part option is selected alongside a brand and model. This involved adding new  hooks and fetch logic to call backend APIs for compatibility data and rendering the results within the product display grid. The necessary frontend code was modified to enable this integration and ensure that relevant track sizes for a selected machine are displayed. The engineer restarted the frontend to apply these changes.

The immediate next step identified was to systematically crawl  to import the missing track sizes and compatibility data, specifically noting that this site contains comprehensive data for track loaders, which was a gap in previously imported data.
